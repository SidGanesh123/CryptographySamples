Code samples using different algorithms

- HMAC-SHA256.py: Used HMAC-SHA256 with a key of all 0's and my name as a string. I then appended the key until the ciphertext began with 123...

- SHA256.py: Hashed my name multiple times until the first three hex digits were 000....

- cipher.py: To learn about AES implentation, I encrypted and decrypted my name (a string) with a random 256-bit key.
